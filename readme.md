## Pony pureness, really?

While polyfills are naughty, ponyfills are pure, just like ponies.


## How are ponyfills better than polyfills?

A [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill) is code that adds missing functionality by [monkey patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) an API. Unfortunately, it usually globally patches built-ins, which affects all code running in the environment. This is especially problematic when a polyfill is not fully spec compliant (which in some cases is impossible), as it could cause very hard to debug bugs and inconsistencies. Or when the spec for a new feature changes and your code depends on behavior that a module somewhere else in the dependency tree polyfills differently. In general, [you should not modify API's you don't own.](https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/03/02/maintainable-javascript-dont-modify-objects-you-down-own/)

A ponyfill, in contrast, doesn't monkey patch anything, but instead exports the functionality as a normal module, so you can use it locally without affecting other code.

*tl;dr;* Polyfills are naughty as they patch native APIs, while ponyfills are pure and don't affect the environment.

### Polyfill

```js
Number.isNaN = Number.isNaN || function (value) {
	return value !== value;
};
```

```js
require('is-nan-polyfill');

Number.isNaN(5);
```

### Ponyfill

```js
module.exports = function (value) {
	return value !== value;
};
```

```js
var isNanPonyfill = require('is-nan-ponyfill');

isNanPonyfill(5);
```

**Ponyfills should never use the native API, even if available,** as it might have slightly different behavior between environments, which can cause bugs.


## Where can I find ponyfills?

[Search npm.](https://npms.io/search?q=keywords%3Aponyfill)


## How do I make a ponyfill?

- Read the specification or source code of the feature you want to ponyfill.
- Initialize an [npm package](https://github.com/sindresorhus/generator-nm).
- [Write some tests](https://ava.li) to ease writing the ponyfill logic.
- Link to documentation about the feature in your readme. [Example.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/buffer-includes#readme)
- Link to [ponyfill.com](https://ponyfill.com) in your readme. [Example.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign#readme)
- Add `ponyfill` to the `keywords` section in package.json.
- Publish!
